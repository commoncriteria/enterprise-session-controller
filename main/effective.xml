    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="sec-TOEdescription">
	<h:p>The Target of Evaluation (TOE) that is defined by the combination of the NDcPP and this PP-Module is a
network device, either a dedicated appliance with a non-modifiable operating system, or a generalpurpose server running an independent commercially-available operating system that provides ESC
functionality. Regardless of whether the TOE is a standalone appliance or a general-purpose server that is
configured to function as an ESC, the TOE must be capable of satisfying all of the mandatory requirements
of the NDcPP.</h:p><h:p>An ESC is a privately-owned telecommunication switch where its primary function is to set up, process,
and terminate voice and video calls over an enterprise-wide Internet Protocol (IP) network. ESC operation
is analogous to the tasks of 1930’stelephone switchboard-operators, which is to patch (connect) together
callers to callees. But today’s ESC executes switchboard operations automatically, while providing
simultaneous connectivity to hundreds of callers virtually instantaneously. In addition to establishing,
processing, and managing thousands of connected calls, most ESCs support auxiliary services such as
VVoIP Conferencing, Voicemail, Chat, Telepresence, Encrypted Communications, and Protocol Translation
for end-to-end connectivity of diverse endpoints.</h:p><h:p>ESCs are commonly known as Call Servers, Communications Servers, and Call-Processing Systems, and
they vary in complexities and capabilities. The typical ESC can manage thousands of calls between diverse
client devices such as VoIP-handsets, Softphones, Desktop Telepresence Systems, Room-size Video
Telepresence Systems, and Mobile Devices. ESCs are normally installed within a SCIF or other entrycontrolled environment, especially systems that can register numerous VVoIP endpoints. To protect the
ESC, a Session Border Controller (SBC) is installed on the outer edge of the VVoIP network to help protect
the ESC from external network attacks. Also note that a fairly robust ESC system includes many major
components such as its own database, operating system (O/S), conferencing system, dialplan, network
manager, call-signaling protocols (e.g. H.323, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SS7), and its own
‘Operations, Administration, and Management (OA&amp;M)’ application system.</h:p><h:p>If any one of these major components is successfully attacked, then one can expect the entire ESC system
to be negatively impacted. The intention of this PP-Module is to provide a list of security requirements
needed by an ESC for protection of its functionality and protection of the VVoIP communications it is
responsible for facilitating.</h:p>
		</section>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
	  <h:p>An ESC is a logical component of a physical hardware appliance that is responsible for establishing
connectivity between VVoIP endpoints. The ESC is an advanced version of a legacy IP-PBX system. As a
specific type of network device, an ESC TOE will be evaluated against both the NDcPP and this PP-Module.
All functionality described by the SFRs are within the TOE boundary, as is the ability for the TSF to establish
secure remote connections with trusted entities in the OE.</h:p><h:p>Figure 1 below shows a typical VVoIP infrastructure in which an ESC is deployed.</h:p>
        <figure entity="images/network_diagram.png" title="Representative ESC Deployment" id="toe"/>
		<h:p>As can be seen from this figure, the ESC’s purpose is to provide an interface between VVoIP networks in order
		to connect calls. The ESC depends on or communicates with a number of services that are located within the
		internal network such as voicemail, conferencing, Network Time Protocol (NTP), Domain Name System, and
		software updates that are downloaded from VVoIP endpoint manufacturers and stored on the ESC for
		distribution to the clients.</h:p><h:p>Certain storage capabilities may be implemented exclusively within the TOE or within both the TOE and its OE (such as the TOE maintaining an internal audit log that is also written to an external audit server).</h:p><h:p>For connecting networks, the ESC relies on edge routing to handle lower-level communications between
		the networks and on a SBC to filter out potentially malicious activity.</h:p><h:p>The ESC itself, which can be administered locally or remotely, consists of several different logical
		components, as shown in Figure 2 below.</h:p>
		<figure entity="images/components_diagram.png" title="ESC Components" id="c-toe"/>
		<h:p>As can be seen from the figure above, the ESC provides the following logical capabilities:</h:p><h:ul>
		<h:li>OA&amp;M – Responsible for providing a management interface to the ESC’s configuration.</h:li>
		<h:li>Call Processing – Responsible for setting up and tearing down calls between VVoIP endpoints using
		one or more call control protocols.</h:li>
		<h:li>Call Detail Records – Responsible for storage of call activity for auditing purposes.</h:li>
		<h:li>Voice/Video Media Conferencing, Controls, and Storage – responsible for establishing multi-way
		conference calls and storage of call recordings.</h:li>
		</h:ul>Different ESCs may implement these capabilities in different ways. This PP-Module defines a minimum
baseline of capabilities that all conformant ESCs must provide.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>

	  <sec:Use_Cases>
	  <h:p>Requirements in this PP-Module are designed to address the security problem in the following use cases.
		Use cases are not mutually exclusive; a TOE may implement more than one of these use cases. The
		description of these use cases provide instructions for how the TOE and its OE should be made to support
		the functionality required by this PP-Module.
		</h:p><h:p>This PP-Module defines four potential use cases for the ESC TOE:</h:p>
	  
	   <usecases>
        <usecase id="usecase1" title="Dedicated Appliance">
          <description>The ESC is sold and packaged as a standalone network appliance that does not have a direct interface to the underlying platform operating system, customized application, or commercialoff-the-shelf database.</description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase2" title="Call Processing (Connect VVoIP Calls Together)">
          <description>The ESC serves as a call control system that employs multiple technologies for processing and
			managing voice/video calls between end-point devices. The ESC receives a call-request message
			from the source IP-phone (endpoint-A) and then locates and connects the call-originator to the
			destination device (endpoint-B). The ESC is used as a centralized system to process, manage, and
			connect calls between registered IP-phones. It should be noted that H.323 and SIP are the ESC’s
			most commonly used call-processing (i.e. call control) protocols. Both H.323 and SIP are used to
			set up, process, and terminate voice/video calls between endpoints. Supplemental call control
			protocols such as Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and SS7 do not limit ESC capabilities,
			but instead enhances its functionality. Both H.323 and SIP provide an ESC with the capabilities
			required for execution of all use cases. Both H.323 and SIP provide the ESC with call control
			capabilities, support trunking between the ESC and Service Providers, support trunking between
			an array of ESCs, and can use encryption schemes that secure the ESC’s call control functions.
					</description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase3" title="Trunk Calls to/from Telecommunications Service Provider">
          <description>The ESC may support the ability to bundle numerous calls that originate from locally-registered
			VVoIP devices onto an ESC’s communication trunk for connectivity through a telecommunications
			service provider (e.g. Verizon) to remote endpoints. In this case, the ESC supports the aggregation
			of traffic for all registered IP devices for the purpose of passing local calls over a single trunk to an
			external service provider. This allows for a simplified network deployment where a single
			connection from the ESC to the service provider can support a large number of devices, rather
			than requiring each individual device to connect to the service provider separately.
          </description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase4" title="Trunk Calls in/out to Remote ESCs">
          <description>Similar to trunking calls to telecommunications service providers, the ESC can trunk a large volume
			of calls to other remote ESCs. An example of this deployment is a meshed configuration of trunkconnected ESCs that are deployed to support a metropolitan-sized enterprise-wide VVoIP callprocessing network. This particular type of use case may not require any of the meshed ESCs to
			be connected to a service provider.

  <section title="Security Problem Definition" id="sec-spd">
  <h:p>The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions
	about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to
	enforce.</h:p>
	<h:p>The ESC is a network appliance that incorporates multiple components and protocols, and is designed
	with the purpose of connecting and managing calls that emanate from registered VVoIP endpoints. The
	ESC is also designed to provide centralized control of an enterprise-wide VVoIP communication network.
	As the central control system that manages and processes VVoIP calls from as many as 50,000 endpoints
	per node, it is critically important for the ESC to be protected because it is a single point of failure for tens
	of thousands of end-users.</h:p>
	<h:p>As a centralized system the ESC is subject to attacks from the VVoIP endpoints that are registered to the
	ESC. Any VVoIP endpoint could be a threat to launch a malicious attack against the ESC. Therefore the ESC
	shall possess the security requirements needed for mitigating such a threat type.
	</h:p>
	<h:p>Note that as PP-Module of the NDcPP, all threats, assumptions, and Organizational Security Policies (OSPs)
	defined there will also apply to an ESC TOE unless otherwise specified.
	</h:p>
	<h:p>The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are
	defined in the PP-Module but will also mitigate some NDcPP threats in more comprehensive detail due to
	the specific capabilities provided by an ESC.</h:p>


    <section title="Threats" id="sec-threats">
	The following threats defined in this PP-Module extend the threats defined by the Base-PP.
	
      <threats>
        <threat name="T.MALICIOUS_TRAFFIC" id="t-malicious-traffic">
		
          <description> A malformed packet is a protocol packet containing modified data not recognizable by the receiving
			device (e.g. TOE), or contains modified protocol packets intended to crash or cause the TOE to act in
			ways unintended. An attacker may attempt to use a VVoIP endpoint to send these malformed packets
			or malicious traffic towards the TOE in an attempt to control or crash the call control system and
			connected network devices. To mitigate VVoIP endpoint devices from being used to successfully
			launch malicious traffic, the TOE must provide encryption remedies to prevent modification of
			protocol packets. The TOE must also provide authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
			VVoIP endpoints from improperly registering to the ESC for the purpose of launching malicious
			attacks.</description>

	 	The threats defined by this PP-Module (see section 3.1) supplement those defined in the NDcPP as follows:

      <con-obj/>
      <con-op-en>The objectives for the TOE’s operational environment are consistent with the NDcPP based on the
following rationale: </con-op-en>
      
      
      <con-mod ref="T.MALICIOUS_TRAFFIC">The Base-PP does not define a threat for malicious traffic because all of its
		security-relevant external interfaces define the network device as the
		endpoint. This PP-Module defines interfaces where the TOE is facilitating a
		connection between two external entities, such that traffic between them will
		flow “through” the TOE as opposed to “to/from the TOE.” This threat is
		consistent with the Base-PP because it is only applied to the interfaces defined
		in this PP-Module where it is relevant; it does not apply to the interfaces
		defined in the Base-PP.
	  </con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="T.NETWORK_DISCLOSURE">
		The Base-PP does not define a threat for access to network resources because
		all of its security-relevant external interfaces define the network device as the
		endpoint. This PP-Module defines interfaces where the TOE is facilitating a
		connection between two external entities, such that traffic between them will
		flow “through” the TOE as opposed to “to/from the TOE.” This threat is
		consistent with the Base-PP because it is only applied to the interfaces defined
		in this PP-Module where it is relevant; it does not apply to the interfaces

	  </con-mod>
	  <con-mod ref="T.UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT">
		This threat is a specific instance of the
		T.WEAK_AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINTS threat defined in the Base-PP
		because it refers to a scenario where an unauthorized client is able to
		communicate successfully with the TOE because the TSF is incapable of
		authenticating clients to determine which are or are not authorized.
	  </con-mod>
	  <con-mod ref="P.SECURED_PLATFORM">
		The Base-PP does not define any policies that expect that environmental
		systems are configured in any specific manner. Therefore, it is expected that requiring environmental systems to be configured in a secure manner will not
		prevent the TSF from being fully implemented.
	  </con-mod>
	  <con-mod ref="OE.SECURED_PLATFORM">
		This objective expects the TOE to be configured in such a manner that the
		underlying OS on which the TOE runs cannot be used to alter the behavior of
		the TSF. This is consistent with the OE.NO_GENERAL_PURPOSE objective in
		the Base-PP that expects that general-purpose computing capability will be
		prohibited by the OS. This ensures that OE.SECURED_PLATFORM can be
		satisfied by the operational environment.

		from the TOE’s NIC; or as TOE Administrator, issue command to logically take down IP connection. Peruse
		system logs to confirm IP connection is down. After confirming IP connection as down, reconnect IP or
		logically bring up IP connection and confirm IP status as up. Repeat for each physical network interface of
		the TOE.</test>
		<test id="fau-log-cpu-usage">(CPU usage): The evaluator shall use the TOE and monitor the CPU usage status over a period of 10
		minutes and observe that fluctuations in CPU usage are reported. It is not necessary to verify that this
		information is accurate at a low level but the evaluator is expected to justify at a high level why these
		fluctuations are occurring (e.g. CPU usage spikes while the TOE is establishing a call).
		</test>
		<test id="fau-log-memory-usage">(memory usage): The evaluator shall use the TOE and monitor the memory usage status over a
		period of 10 minutes and observe that fluctuations in memory usage are reported. It is not necessary to
		verify that this information is accurate at a low level but the evaluator is expected to justify at a high level
		why these fluctuations are occurring (e.g. memory usage spikes while the TOE is establishing a call or
		downloading an update).</test>
		<test id="fau-log-disk-and-file-storage-capacity">(disk and file storage capacity): The evaluator shall use the TOE and monitor the disk capacity status
		over a period of 10 minutes and observe that fluctuations in storage capacity are reported. It is not
		necessary to verify that this information is accurate at a low level but the evaluator is expected to justify
		at a high level why these changes are occurring (e.g. the evaluator transfers a file with a known file size to
		a disk partition and observes that the available space decreased by a corresponding amount).</test>
		<test id="fau-log-fan-status">(fan status) (conditional): First, confirm fan is working as designed. Once fan is confirmed
		functioning properly, disconnect fan to shut it down. Peruse system logs to confirm fan has been reported
		as down. After confirming fan as down, reconnect fan and confirm fan as up. Repeat this process for each
		fan that is monitored by the TSF.</test>
		<test id="fau-log-power-status">(power status): <testlist>
			<test id="fau-log-power-status-redundant"> (conditional): If TOE employs redundant power supplies (PS), then test may be a simple matter of
			cycling one PS while leaving other power units untouched. Reset one PS while allowing the other(s) to
			remain up. Peruse system log and verify message indicating PS cycled (went down &amp; up).</test>
			<test id="fau-log-power-status-single">(conditional): If TOE is supported by a single PS, than test has to be verified by waiting for system
			log to provide power status on periodic intervals. If system log does not report power status, then PS test
			failed.</test>

			device itself. In either scenario, the VVoIP endpoint itself will always indicate whether verification of the
			update has failed. Therefore, the tester can (or may have to) verify successful software download by
			querying the VVoIP endpoint device for new software/firmware version. The tester can also verify
			whether software update failed by querying the registered VVoIP endpoint for errors.
			</h:p><h:p>In most cases, failed software update messages will originate from the VVoIP endpoint and not the ESC.
			Any failed software update reported by the registered VVoIP endpoint should have the report forwarded
			to the TOE. However, as mentioned earlier, the registered VVoIP endpoint may not report successful
			software downloads an therefore no ‘successful download’ report should be expected to be forwarded to the ESC. If the VVoIP endpoint does report a ‘software download complete’ or just ‘complete’, then the
			TOE should receive a message indicating that the download was completed. When the VVoIP endpoint
			reboots, it is expected to report the new software/firmware version to the TOE so that the new version
			will be displayed in the OA&amp;M application.</h:p></test>
			<test>The evaluator shall check to ensure that the verification of software/firmware updates from the
			TOE to the VVoIP endpoint fails using unauthorized data or improperly signed updates. The evaluator shall
			also check those cases where hash verification mechanism and digital signature verification mechanism
			fail.
			<h:p>Note: this may require the evaluator to obtain a deliberately invalid software update from the device
			manufacturer or developer access to the TOE so that a stored update can be manipulated directly in a
			manner that will cause signature and/or hash verification to fail.</h:p></test>

	<!-- Entropy documentation -->
	<appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> 
		<h:p>
			This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy
		  source used by the TOE.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after
		  reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why
		  it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should
		  include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification,
		  operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
		  be part of the TSS. 
		</h:p>
		<section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
			<h:p>
		  Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole,
		  including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information
		  that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any
		  third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to
		  include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be
		  obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation
		  should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy
		  comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing
		  of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally,
		  how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the
		  process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source
		  design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  This design must also include a description of the content of the
		  security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how
		  the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary
		  cannot affect the entropy rate.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If implemented, the design description shall include a description
		  of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A
		  description of any RBG state saving between power-off and
		  power-on shall be included.
			</h:p>
		</section>

		<section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
			<h:p>
		  There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in
		  the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source
		  delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output
		  (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of
		  the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per
		  bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is
		  going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will
		  be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied
		  upon to produce bits with entropy.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The amount of information necessary to justify the expected
		  min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
		  product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the
		  min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source
		  bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the
		  min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no
		  particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected
		  that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of
		  min-entropy in each output.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor
		  has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
		  documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy
		  obtained from this third-party source.  It is acceptable for the vendor
		  to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be
		  clearly stated in the documentation provided.  In particular, the
		  min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included
		  in the ST.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also
		  include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST,
		  for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the
		  amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy
		  expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and
		  compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to
		  seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly
		  related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The entropy justification shall not include any data added from
		  any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
			</h:p>
		</section>

		<section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions">
		  The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control
		  of the entropy source itself.  For example, voltage, frequency,
		  temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the
		  factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source.
		  As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions
		  under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
		  It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the
		  system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate
		  under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe
		  the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction
		  or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
		  of the source shall be included.
		</section>

		<section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing">
		  More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale
		  will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
		  the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed
		  (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results
		  for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is
		  believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the
		  entropy source.

		  There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor 
		  wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The 
		  other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce 
		  the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. 
		  But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, 
		  the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
		  and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence 
		  cannot be claimed with that product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
		  Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ 
		  in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the AppPP.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated—or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated 
		  product needs re-evaluation—the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product 
		  Version equivalence to analyze whether Product Versions are equivalent.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
		  Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform 
		  for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
		  affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
		  between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the 
		  functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version 
		  or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or 
		  versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform 
		  differently to perform the function.
			</h:p>

		<section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
		  <h:p>
		  Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across 
		  a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” 
		  edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models 
		  are compliant?
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  Product models are considered equivalent if there are no differences that affect PP-specified security 
		  functionality—as indicated in Table 1.

		  <h:p>
		  Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that equivalent versions of a Product must be tested on. 
		  Platform equivalence analysis done for one software application cannot be applied to another software application.
		  Platform equivalence is not general—it is with respect to a particular application. 
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  Product Equivalency analysis must already have been done and Products have been determined to be equivalent.
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  The platform can be hardware or virtual hardware, an operating system or similar entity, or a software execution 
		  environment such as a container. For purposes of determining equivalence for software applications, we address each
		  type of platform separately. In general, platform equivalence is based on differences in the interfaces between the 
		  TOE and Platform that are relevant to the implementation of PP-specified security functionality.
		  </h:p>
		  <section id="hardware-equiv" title="Platform Equivalence—Hardware/Virtual Hardware Platforms">
			<h:p>
				If an application runs directly on hardware without an operating system—or directly on virtualized 
			hardware without an operating system—then platform equivalence is based on processor architecture and 
			instruction sets. In the case of virtualized hardware, it is the virtualized processor and architecture 
			that are presented to the application that matters—not the physical hardware.
		  </h:p><h:p>
			Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is not 
			likely to be an issue for equivalency analysis for applications since there is likely to be a different 
			version of the application for different hardware environments.
			Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing processors with the same architecture. Processors 
			with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not
			disqualified from being equivalent for purposes of an App evaluation. If the application takes the same 
			code paths when executing PP-specified security functionality on different processors of the same family, 
			then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that application.
			For example, if an application follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction 
			and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that 
			application functionality. But if the application follows the same code path whether or not the platform 
			supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
		  </h:p><h:p>
			The platforms are equivalent with respect to the application if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
			security functionality.
