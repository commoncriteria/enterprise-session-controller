    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="sec-TOEdescription">
	<h:p>The Target of Evaluation (TOE) that is defined by the combination of the NDcPP and this PP-Module is a
network device, either a dedicated appliance with a non-modifiable operating system, or a generalpurpose server running an independent commercially-available operating system that provides ESC
functionality. Regardless of whether the TOE is a standalone appliance or a general-purpose server that is
configured to function as an ESC, the TOE must be capable of satisfying all of the mandatory requirements
of the NDcPP.</h:p><h:p>An ESC is a privately-owned telecommunication switch where its primary function is to set up, process,
and terminate voice and video calls over an enterprise-wide Internet Protocol (IP) network. ESC operation
is analogous to the tasks of 1930’stelephone switchboard-operators, which is to patch (connect) together
callers to callees. But today’s ESC executes switchboard operations automatically, while providing
simultaneous connectivity to hundreds of callers virtually instantaneously. In addition to establishing,
processing, and managing thousands of connected calls, most ESCs support auxiliary services such as
VVoIP Conferencing, Voicemail, Chat, Telepresence, Encrypted Communications, and Protocol Translation
for end-to-end connectivity of diverse endpoints.</h:p><h:p>ESCs are commonly known as Call Servers, Communications Servers, and Call-Processing Systems, and
they vary in complexities and capabilities. The typical ESC can manage thousands of calls between diverse
client devices such as VoIP-handsets, Softphones, Desktop Telepresence Systems, Room-size Video
Telepresence Systems, and Mobile Devices. ESCs are normally installed within a SCIF or other entrycontrolled environment, especially systems that can register numerous VVoIP endpoints. To protect the
ESC, a Session Border Controller (SBC) is installed on the outer edge of the VVoIP network to help protect
the ESC from external network attacks. Also note that a fairly robust ESC system includes many major
components such as its own database, operating system (O/S), conferencing system, dialplan, network
manager, call-signaling protocols (e.g. H.323, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SS7), and its own
‘Operations, Administration, and Management (OA&amp;M)’ application system.</h:p><h:p>If any one of these major components is successfully attacked, then one can expect the entire ESC system
to be negatively impacted. The intention of this PP-Module is to provide a list of security requirements
needed by an ESC for protection of its functionality and protection of the VVoIP communications it is
responsible for facilitating.</h:p>
		</section>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
	  <h:p>An ESC is a logical component of a physical hardware appliance that is responsible for establishing
connectivity between VVoIP endpoints. The ESC is an advanced version of a legacy IP-PBX system. As a
specific type of network device, an ESC TOE will be evaluated against both the NDcPP and this PP-Module.
All functionality described by the SFRs are within the TOE boundary, as is the ability for the TSF to establish
secure remote connections with trusted entities in the OE.</h:p><h:p>Figure 1 below shows a typical VVoIP infrastructure in which an ESC is deployed.</h:p>
        <figure entity="images/network_diagram.png" title="Representative ESC Deployment" id="toe"/>
		<h:p>As can be seen from this figure, the ESC’s purpose is to provide an interface between VVoIP networks in order
		to connect calls. The ESC depends on or communicates with a number of services that are located within the
		internal network such as voicemail, conferencing, Network Time Protocol (NTP), Domain Name System, and
		software updates that are downloaded from VVoIP endpoint manufacturers and stored on the ESC for
		distribution to the clients.</h:p><h:p>Certain storage capabilities may be implemented exclusively within the TOE or within both the TOE and its OE (such as the TOE maintaining an internal audit log that is also written to an external audit server).</h:p><h:p>For connecting networks, the ESC relies on edge routing to handle lower-level communications between
		the networks and on a SBC to filter out potentially malicious activity.</h:p><h:p>The ESC itself, which can be administered locally or remotely, consists of several different logical
		components, as shown in Figure 2 below.</h:p>
		<figure entity="images/components_diagram.png" title="ESC Components" id="c-toe"/>
		<h:p>As can be seen from the figure above, the ESC provides the following logical capabilities:</h:p><h:ul>
		<h:li>OA&amp;M – Responsible for providing a management interface to the ESC’s configuration.</h:li>
		<h:li>Call Processing – Responsible for setting up and tearing down calls between VVoIP endpoints using
		one or more call control protocols.</h:li>
		<h:li>Call Detail Records – Responsible for storage of call activity for auditing purposes.</h:li>
		<h:li>Voice/Video Media Conferencing, Controls, and Storage – responsible for establishing multi-way
		conference calls and storage of call recordings.</h:li>
		</h:ul>Different ESCs may implement these capabilities in different ways. This PP-Module defines a minimum
baseline of capabilities that all conformant ESCs must provide.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>

	  <sec:Use_Cases>
	  <h:p>Requirements in this PP-Module are designed to address the security problem in the following use cases.
Use cases are not mutually exclusive; a TOE may implement more than one of these use cases. The
description of these use cases provide instructions for how the TOE and its OE should be made to support
the functionality required by this PP-Module.
</h:p><h:p>This PP-Module defines four potential use cases for the ESC TOE:</h:p>
	  
	   <usecases>
        <usecase id="usecase1" title="Dedicated Appliance">
          <description>The ESC is sold and packaged as a standalone network appliance that does not have a direct interface to the underlying platform operating system, customized application, or commercialoff-the-shelf database.</description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase1" title="Call Processing (Connect VVoIP Calls Together)">
          <description>The ESC serves as a call control system that employs multiple technologies for processing and
			managing voice/video calls between end-point devices. The ESC receives a call-request message
			from the source IP-phone (endpoint-A) and then locates and connects the call-originator to the
			destination device (endpoint-B). The ESC is used as a centralized system to process, manage, and
			connect calls between registered IP-phones. It should be noted that H.323 and SIP are the ESC’s
			most commonly used call-processing (i.e. call control) protocols. Both H.323 and SIP are used to
			set up, process, and terminate voice/video calls between endpoints. Supplemental call control
			protocols such as Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and SS7 do not limit ESC capabilities,
			but instead enhances its functionality. Both H.323 and SIP provide an ESC with the capabilities
			required for execution of all use cases. Both H.323 and SIP provide the ESC with call control
			capabilities, support trunking between the ESC and Service Providers, support trunking between
			an array of ESCs, and can use encryption schemes that secure the ESC’s call control functions.
					</description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase1" title="Trunk Calls to/from Telecommunications Service Provider">
          <description>The ESC may support the ability to bundle numerous calls that originate from locally-registered
			VVoIP devices onto an ESC’s communication trunk for connectivity through a telecommunications
			service provider (e.g. Verizon) to remote endpoints. In this case, the ESC supports the aggregation
			of traffic for all registered IP devices for the purpose of passing local calls over a single trunk to an
			external service provider. This allows for a simplified network deployment where a single
			connection from the ESC to the service provider can support a large number of devices, rather
			than requiring each individual device to connect to the service provider separately.
          </description>
        </usecase>
		<usecase id="usecase1" title="Trunk Calls in/out to Remote ESCs">
          <description>Similar to trunking calls to telecommunications service providers, the ESC can trunk a large volume
			of calls to other remote ESCs. An example of this deployment is a meshed configuration of trunkconnected ESCs that are deployed to support a metropolitan-sized enterprise-wide VVoIP callprocessing network. This particular type of use case may not require any of the meshed ESCs to
			be connected to a service provider.

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">

      The Security Objectives in <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> were constructed
      to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
      in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      o be performed are specified both in 
      <xref to="SFRs"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/>
      After the  ST has been approved for evaluation, the TSEF will obtain the
        OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.
     <section title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <xref to="bibCEM"/>.</section>
      <section title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the OS is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the TSS portion of the ST. The OS developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <xref to="SFRs"/> should provide the ST authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.
          <a-component cc-id="adv_fsp.1" name="Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)">The
          functional specification describes the TSFIs. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              updates to the OS by verifying a digital signature – this may be
              done by the OS or the underlying platform. The evaluator will

              update itself. This should include instructions for making the update accessible to
              the OS (e.g., placement in a specific directory). Instructions for
              initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was
              successful or unsuccessful. This includes generation of the hash/digital signature.
              The OS will likely contain security functionality that does not
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP. The operational guidance shall make it

              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in

              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the

              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting

	<!-- Entropy documentation -->
	<appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> 
		<h:p>
			This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy
		  source used by the TOE.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after
		  reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why
		  it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should
		  include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification,
		  operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
		  be part of the TSS. 
		</h:p>
		<section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
			<h:p>
		  Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole,
		  including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information
		  that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any
		  third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to
		  include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be
		  obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation
		  should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy
		  comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing
		  of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally,
		  how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the
		  process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source
		  design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  This design must also include a description of the content of the
		  security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how
		  the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary
		  cannot affect the entropy rate.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If implemented, the design description shall include a description
		  of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A
		  description of any RBG state saving between power-off and
		  power-on shall be included.
			</h:p>
		</section>

		<section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
			<h:p>
		  There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in
		  the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source
		  delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output
		  (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of
		  the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per
		  bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is
		  going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will
		  be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied
		  upon to produce bits with entropy.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The amount of information necessary to justify the expected
		  min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
		  product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the
		  min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source
		  bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the
		  min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no
		  particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected
		  that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of
		  min-entropy in each output.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor
		  has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
		  documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy
		  obtained from this third-party source.  It is acceptable for the vendor
		  to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be
		  clearly stated in the documentation provided.  In particular, the
		  min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included
		  in the ST.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also
		  include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST,
		  for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the
		  amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy
		  expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and
		  compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to
		  seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly
		  related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The entropy justification shall not include any data added from
		  any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
			</h:p>
		</section>

		<section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions">
		  The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control
		  of the entropy source itself.  For example, voltage, frequency,
		  temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the
		  factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source.
		  As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions
		  under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
		  It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the
		  system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate
		  under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe
		  the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction
		  or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
		  of the source shall be included.
		</section>

		<section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing">
		  More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale
		  will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
		  the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed
		  (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results
		  for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is
		  believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the
		  entropy source.

	<appendix id="apndx-equiv" title="Application Software Equivalency Guidelines">
		
		<section id="approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
			<h:p>
		  There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor 
		  wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The 
		  other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce 
		  the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. 
		  But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, 
		  the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
		  and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence 
		  cannot be claimed with that product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
		  Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ 
		  in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the AppPP.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated—or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated 
		  product needs re-evaluation—the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product 
		  Version equivalence to analyze whether Product Versions are equivalent.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
		  Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform 
		  for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
		  affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
			</h:p><h:p>
		  If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
		  between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the 
		  functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version 
		  or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or 
		  versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform 
		  differently to perform the function.
			</h:p>
		</section>
		<section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
		  <h:p>
		  Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across 
		  a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” 
		  edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models 
		  are compliant?
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  Product models are considered equivalent if there are no differences that affect PP-specified security 
		  functionality—as indicated in Table 1.

		<section id="platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
		  <h:p>
		  Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that equivalent versions of a Product must be tested on. 
		  Platform equivalence analysis done for one software application cannot be applied to another software application.
		  Platform equivalence is not general—it is with respect to a particular application. 
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  Product Equivalency analysis must already have been done and Products have been determined to be equivalent.
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  The platform can be hardware or virtual hardware, an operating system or similar entity, or a software execution 
		  environment such as a container. For purposes of determining equivalence for software applications, we address each
		  type of platform separately. In general, platform equivalence is based on differences in the interfaces between the 
		  TOE and Platform that are relevant to the implementation of PP-specified security functionality.
		  </h:p>
		  <section id="hardware-equiv" title="Platform Equivalence—Hardware/Virtual Hardware Platforms">
			<h:p>
				If an application runs directly on hardware without an operating system—or directly on virtualized 
			hardware without an operating system—then platform equivalence is based on processor architecture and 
			instruction sets. In the case of virtualized hardware, it is the virtualized processor and architecture 
			that are presented to the application that matters—not the physical hardware.
		  </h:p><h:p>
			Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is not 
			likely to be an issue for equivalency analysis for applications since there is likely to be a different 
			version of the application for different hardware environments.
			Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing processors with the same architecture. Processors 
			with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not
			disqualified from being equivalent for purposes of an App evaluation. If the application takes the same 
			code paths when executing PP-specified security functionality on different processors of the same family, 
			then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that application.
			For example, if an application follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction 
			and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that 
			application functionality. But if the application follows the same code path whether or not the platform 
			supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
		  </h:p><h:p>
			The platforms are equivalent with respect to the application if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
			security functionality.

			For traditional applications that are built for and run on operating systems, platform equivalence is 
			determined by the interfaces between the application and the operating system that are relevant to PP-specified 
			security functionality. Generally, these are the processor interface, device interfaces, and OS APIs. The following

			If an Application is built for and runs in a non-OS software-based execution environment, such as a Container or 
			Java Runtime, then the below criteria must be used to determine platform equivalence. The key point is that the 
			underlying hardware (virtual or physical) and OS is not relevant to platform equivalence. This allows applications 
			to be tested and run on software-based execution environments on any hardware—as in cloud deployments.

		  In order to make equivalency determinations, the vendor and evaluator must agree on the equivalency claims. They must 
		  then provide the scheme with sufficient information about the TOE instances and platforms that were evaluated, and the 
		  TOE instances and platforms that are claimed to be equivalent.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The ST must describe all configurations evaluated down to processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  The information regarding claimed equivalent configurations depends on the platform that the application was developed for and runs on.
			</h:p><h:p>
		  <h:b>Bare-Metal Applications</h:b>
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For applications that run without an operating system on bare-metal or virtual bare-metal, the claimed configuration must 
		  describe the platform down to the specific processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version. The Vendor
		  must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions
		  differently to leverage platform differences (e.g., instruction set extensions) in the tested configuration versus the 
		  claimed equivalent configuration. 
			</h:p><h:p>
		  <h:b>Traditional Applications</h:b>
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For applications that run with an operating system as their immediate platform, the claimed configuration must describe 
		  the platform down to the specific operating system version. If the platform is a virtualization system, then the claimed 
		  configuration must describe the platform down to the specific virtualization system version. The Vendor must describe the 
		  differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions differently to leverage
		  platform differences in the tested configuration versus the claimed equivalent configuration. Relevant platform differences 
		  could include instruction sets, device interfaces, and OS APIs invoked by the TOE to implement PP-specified security 
		  functionality.

		  <h:b>Software-Based Execution Environments</h:b>
			</h:p><h:p>
		  For applications that run in a software-based execution environment such as a Java virtual machine or a Container, then 
		  the claimed configuration must describe the platform down to the specific version of the software execution environment. 
		  The Vendor must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE 
		  functions differently to leverage platform differences in the tested configuration versus the claimed equivalent 
		  configuration.
